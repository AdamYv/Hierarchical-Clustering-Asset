## Educational Concepts
Hierarchical Clustering
Distance Metric: $d = \sqrt{(2(1-ρ))}$ converts correlation to proper distance

Linkage Method: Ward's method minimizes within-cluster variance

Dendrogram: Visual representation of hierarchical relationships

## Portfolio Theory
Diversification: Reduces risk through low-correlation assets

Equal Weighting: Naive diversification strategy

Cluster Allocation: Systematic exposure across asset classes

## Risk Metrics
Effective N: Number of independent assets (1/Herfindahl)

Diversification Ratio: Weighted volatility / Portfolio volatility

Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return measure
