Educational Concepts
Hierarchical Clustering

    Distance Metric: d = √(2(1-ρ)) converts correlation to proper distance
    Linkage Method: Ward's method minimizes within-cluster variance
    Dendrogram: Visual representation of hierarchical relationships

Portfolio Theory

    Diversification: Reduces risk through low-correlation assets
    Equal Weighting: Naive diversification strategy
    Cluster Allocation: Systematic exposure across asset classes

Risk Metrics

    Effective N: Number of independent assets (1/Herfindahl)
    Diversification Ratio: Weighted volatility / Portfolio volatility
    Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return measure
